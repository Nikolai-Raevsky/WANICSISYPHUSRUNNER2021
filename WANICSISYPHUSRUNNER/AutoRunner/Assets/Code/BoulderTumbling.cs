 * Name: Nikolai Raevsky

 * Desc: Attach this to an obstacle to control it's vertical movement behavior
 * Generic Pseudocode so I don't get Lost:
 * 1. Have a variable that contains the player's transform component for the earlier tests so you can 
 * 2. Set up a collision function so you can stop the boulder from needlessly bumping into the floor and falling off the face of the earth.
 * 3. Maybe use a collider object on the top of the screen to stop boulders from flying off the screen?
 * NOTE: I'm actually not sure if this is necessary yet tbh. I might be able to implment this file's functionality inside of Obstacle.cs
